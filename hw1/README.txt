When TA unzip the zip file, TA can see 5 files as following:

- hw1.py	: The source code of hw1
- train6.txt    : The training data for Problem 6
- train7.txt    : The training data for Problem 7
- test7.txt     : The testing data for Problem 7
- README.txt	

Please do not modify the file name of the training and testing data, 
or the program will crash.

TA can type python3 hw1.py to run the code, and the result will be 
printed on the command line.

If TA want to see the result of histogram, you can command the commanded part
(line 110-113 and line 127-136) of code to see the histogram.
