When TA unzip the zip file, TA can see 4 files as following:

- hw3.py	: The source code of hw3
- hw3_train.txt    : The training data for Q7 and Q8
- hw3_test.txt    : The testing data for Q7 and Q8
- README.txt	

Please do not modify the file name of the training and testing data, 
or the program will crash.

TA can type python3 hw3.py to run the code, and the plot will show on the screen.

Thank you.
